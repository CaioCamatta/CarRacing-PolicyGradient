# CarRacing-PolicyGradient
A well-commented application of Monte Carlo Policy Gradient on OpenAI's Gym CarRacing-v0 enviroment.

The model is still not perfect, but it demonstrates how Policy Gradient works.
I tried to put as much comments as possible to try and help anyone who's struggling with Policy Gradients.

Based on this great course: https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course.
