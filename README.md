# CarRacing-PolicyGradient
A well-commented application of Monte Carlo Policy Gradient on OpenAI's Gym CarRacing-v0 enviroment.

The model is still not perfect, but it demonstrates how Policy Gradient works.
I tried to put as much comments as possible to try and help anyone who's struggling with Policy Gradients.

This environment is not very good compared to other OpenAI envs, so making a decent neural network is a hard challenge. I tried changing a number of things (like making each game a batch and discounting rewards afterwards) to improve the algorithm.

Based on this great course: https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course.
